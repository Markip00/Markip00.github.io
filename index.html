            <p><b>Holy War Genesis</b> is a fast-paced traditional fighter where the gods of mythos
                from many different cultures and times clash together. While in the alpha stage, the
            game only has training and arcade modes, we plan to add quite a few more modes to the game
            that will hopefully make Holy War Genesis a worthwile experience. Our biggest priority lies
            in developing the Online Mode with rollback netcode, but, later down the line, we have plans
            to add an RPG style Campaign mode where you play as one of the many deithic beings fighting
            for control over the mortal world. For now, however, we are focusing on getting feedback to
            develop the core features of the game before we start working on extraneous modes. Thank you
            for checking out Holy War Genesis, and we hope to provide more features down the road for you
            to mess with. </p>
