            <h1>Weekly Update - November 13, 2023</h1><br>
            <p>We've been adding some new touches to the website to make it feel more complete. Updating character pages,
            adding some nice looking styling, and making sure we have a cool website for the game!</p>
            <p>In terms of the actual game, we've just about finished everything we need to go into Alpha! We just need
            some final touches before we're able to get the alpha in your hands.</p>
            <p>Thank you for supporting us this far! It means a lot to us, and we cannot wait to finally give you
            a piece of what will evnetually become Holy War Genesis!</p><br/>

            <h1>Weekly Update - November 6, 2023</h1><br/>
            <p><b>GREAT NEWS!</b> We've finally wrapped up development on our final character for the alpha, Jormungandr.
            He's our resident grappler <i>(but I promise he will not be the only one)</i>, and he packs quite a punch. With
            his development coming to a close, we can now turn our attention to finishing this website and fixing any major
            bugs before our alpha release! We're also getting that much closer to the alpha release, and by extension, the
            full release! That's all we have for now, thanks for reading!</p>
